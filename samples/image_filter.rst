:Syntax: 
    **image_filter**  ``off`` 
 
    **image_filter**  ``test`` 
 
    **image_filter**  ``size`` 
 
    **image_filter**  ``rotate``   ``90``  |  ``180``  |  ``270`` 
 
    **image_filter**  ``resize``   *width*   *height* 
 
    **image_filter**  ``crop``   *width*   *height* 
 
:Default:
    None
 
:Context: 
     ``location`` 
 

Sets the type of transformation to perform on images:
 
 ``off``    
   turns off module processing in a surrounding location.  
 ``test``    
   ensures that responses are images in either JPEG, GIF, or PNG format. Otherwise, the error  ``415 (Unsupported Media Type)``  is returned.  
 ``size``    
   outputs information about images in a JSON format, e.g.:     
    
    ::
    { "img" : { "width": 100, "height": 100, "type": "gif" } }
    
    
In case of an error, the following is output:
    
    
    ::
    {}
    
    
 
 ``rotate``   ``90`` | ``180`` | ``270``     
   rotates images counter-clockwise by the specified number of degrees. Value of the parameter can contain variables. Can be used either alone, or along with the  ``resize``  and  ``crop``  transformations.  
 ``resize``   ``width``   ``height``     
   proportionally reduces an image to the specified sizes. To reduce by only one dimension, another dimension can be specified as " ``-`` ". In case of an error, the server will return code  ``415 (Unsupported Media Type)`` . Values of parameters can contain variables. When used along with the  ``rotate``  parameter, the rotation happens  **after**  reduction.  
 ``crop``   ``width``   ``height``     
   proportionally reduces an image to the size of the largest side and crops extraneous edges by another side. To reduce by only one dimension, another dimension can be specified as " ``-`` ". In case of an error, the server will return code  ``415 (Unsupported Media Type)`` . Values of parameters can contain variables. When used along with the  ``rotate``  parameter, the rotation happens  **before**  reduction.
